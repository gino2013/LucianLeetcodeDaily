# 679. 24 Game

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array cards of length 4. You have four cards, each containing a number in the range [1, 9]. You should arrange the numbers on these cards in a mathematical expression using the operators ['+', '-', '*', '/'] and the parentheses '(' and ')' to get the value 24.

You are restricted with the following rules:

- The division operator '/' represents real division, not integer division.
- Every operation done is between two numbers. In particular, we cannot use '-' as a unary operator.
- You cannot concatenate numbers together

Return true if you can get such expression that evaluates to 24, and false otherwise.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: cards = [4,1,8,7]
Output: true
Explanation: (8-4) * (7-1) = 24
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: cards = [1,2,1,2]
Output: false
```

## Constraints

- cards.length == 4
- 1 <= cards[i] <= 9

## Solution Approach

This is a classic backtracking problem using DFS (Depth-First Search). The key insight is that any mathematical expression with 4 numbers and 3 operations can be represented as a binary tree of operations.

**Algorithm:**
1. Use recursive DFS with a list of remaining numbers
2. At each step, pick any two numbers (using i < j to avoid duplicates) and combine them with each operation
3. For addition and multiplication, order doesn't matter: `a + b = b + a`
4. For subtraction, try both orders: `a - b` and `b - a`
5. For division, check for zero divisor before attempting division
6. Replace the two numbers with the result and recurse
7. Base case: when only one number remains, check if it equals 24 (within epsilon tolerance)

**Optimizations:**
- Use `j = i + 1` instead of `j != i` to avoid duplicate combinations
- Group non-commutative operations efficiently
- Early termination when a valid expression is found

**Time Complexity:** O(1) - Since there are only 4 cards, the number of possible expressions is constant
**Space Complexity:** O(1) - Constant space for recursion stack

## Key Implementation Details

- Convert integers to floats using `map(float, cards)` for precise division
- Use epsilon tolerance (1e-6) for floating-point comparison with 24
- Handle division by zero by checking if divisor magnitude > 1e-6
- Optimize by avoiding redundant pair selections (i < j pattern)
