# 2110. Number of Smooth Descent Periods of a Stock

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array `prices` representing the daily price history of a stock, where `prices[i]` is the stock price on the ith day.

A **smooth descent period** of a stock consists of one or more contiguous days such that the price on each day is lower than the price on the preceding day by exactly 1. The first day of the period is exempted from this rule.

Return the number of smooth descent periods.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: prices = [3,2,1,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: There are 7 smooth descent periods:
[3], [2], [1], [4], [3,2], [2,1], and [3,2,1]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: prices = [8,6,7,7]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 smooth descent periods: [8], [6], [7], and [7]
Note that [8,6] is not a smooth descent period as 8 - 6 ≠ 1.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: prices = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is 1 smooth descent period: [1]
```

### Constraints
- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= prices[i] <= 10^5`

## Solution Approach

### Key Insight
The problem is about counting all possible subarrays where consecutive elements decrease by exactly 1.

For a descent period of length `n`, the number of subarrays it contains is:
- 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n × (n + 1) / 2

However, we can optimize this by observing that:
- Each element contributes to the count based on how long the current descent period is
- If we're at position `i` with a descent period of length `k`, then there are `k` subarrays ending at position `i`

### Algorithm
1. Initialize `result = 0` and `length = 1` (current descent period length)
2. Iterate through the prices array:
   - If current price = previous price - 1, increment `length`
   - Otherwise, reset `length = 1` (new descent period starts)
   - Add `length` to `result` (number of subarrays ending at current position)
3. Return `result`

### Example Walkthrough

**Input:** `prices = [3,2,1,4]`

| i | prices[i] | Condition | length | Subarrays ending at i | result |
|---|-----------|-----------|--------|-----------------------|--------|
| 0 | 3 | - | 1 | [3] | 1 |
| 1 | 2 | 2 = 3-1 ✓ | 2 | [2], [3,2] | 3 |
| 2 | 1 | 1 = 2-1 ✓ | 3 | [1], [2,1], [3,2,1] | 6 |
| 3 | 4 | 4 ≠ 1-1 ✗ | 1 | [4] | 7 |

**Output:** 7

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) - Single pass through the array
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - Only using constant extra space

## Edge Cases
1. Single element array: Returns 1
2. No descent periods of length > 1: Each element is counted individually
3. Entire array is a descent period: Formula applies to the whole array
4. Multiple descent periods: Each is counted independently
