## Explanation of the Python Code: Finding the Minimum Time to Reach the Bottom-Right Room in a Grid with Time Constraints

This Python code efficiently computes the minimum time required to move from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a grid. Each room in the grid has a constraint: you can only start entering it at or after a certain time (`moveTime[i][j]`). You can only move to adjacent cells (up/down/left/right), and each move takes exactly 1 second.

The solution is based on a modified version of **Dijkstra's algorithm**, adapted to account for the time constraint on each room.

### 1. Initialization:

* `rows` and `cols`: represent the dimensions of the grid.
* `min_arrival_time`: a 2D matrix of the same size as `moveTime`, used to record the shortest known time to arrive at each room. Initialized with infinity (`inf`) except for the starting point at `(0, 0)`, which is set to `0`.
* `heap`: a min-heap (priority queue) that keeps track of the next room to explore, prioritizing rooms with the smallest arrival time. Each element is a tuple `(current_time, row, col)`.

---

### 2. Main Algorithm Loop (Modified Dijkstra):

* The loop continues as long as there are entries in the heap.
* At each step, the algorithm pops the cell `(row, col)` with the smallest current time from the heap.
* If this cell is the destination `(rows - 1, cols - 1)`, the algorithm immediately returns the current time, as we have reached the goal with the minimum possible cost.

### 3. Exploring Neighboring Rooms:

* The code checks all 4 adjacent rooms (up, down, left, right).
* For each neighbor `(new_row, new_col)`:

  * **Wait Rule**: If you reach early, you have to wait until `moveTime[new_row][new_col]`, then spend 1 second to move in.
  * Thus, the **earliest arrival time** to the new room is:

    ```python
    wait_time = max(curr_time, moveTime[new_row][new_col]) + 1
    ```
* If this new `wait_time` is **less than** the currently recorded `min_arrival_time` for that room, the algorithm updates the time and adds the new state to the heap.

### 4. Key Variables Explained:

| Variable           | Description                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rows`, `cols`     | Dimensions of the grid                                              |
| `min_arrival_time` | 2D matrix to record the shortest arrival time to each room          |
| `heap`             | Priority queue for Dijkstra traversal                               |
| `curr_time`        | Current time at which we're visiting a room                         |
| `directions`       | List of 4 directions to explore from the current room               |
| `wait_time`        | Actual time to reach a neighboring room, considering its `moveTime` |

### 5. Early Exit Optimization:

* As soon as the algorithm reaches the destination cell `(rows - 1, cols - 1)`, it returns the time without further processing.

---

### In Essence:

The code finds the **fastest path from `(0, 0)` to `(n-1, m-1)`**, considering:

* Movement costs (1 second per adjacent move), and
* Constraints (`moveTime[i][j]`) which dictate when a room can be entered.

By using a priority queue and always expanding the earliest reachable cells, the algorithm guarantees the minimum arrival time at the destination. This approach runs efficiently even on large grids due to its priority-based search.
