# Explanation of the Python Code: Calculating Minimum Cost Between Nodes

This Python code efficiently computes the minimum cost between pairs of nodes in an undirected graph, given the number of nodes `n`, a list of edges `edges`, and a list of queries `query`. It utilizes the Union-Find (Disjoint Set) algorithm with path compression to manage connected components and bitwise AND operations to determine the minimum cost within each component. The solution operates with near-linear time complexity for edge processing and queries.

Here’s a breakdown of the code’s logic:

## 1. Initialization

* `parent` Array: Represents the parent of each node in the Union-Find structure. Initially set to `list(range(n))`, where each node is its own parent, indicating independent components.
* `min_path_cost` Array: Tracks the minimum cost for each connected component, initialized to `-1` (all bits 1 in binary) to serve as the starting value for bitwise AND operations.

## 2. Union-Find Approach

The code employs a Union-Find technique in the `find_root` method to efficiently identify and merge connected components while maintaining their minimum costs.

The main method, `minimumCost`, processes edges to build components and then answers queries based on connectivity and cost.

## 3. Processing Edges and Computing Costs

* **Edge Handling**: For each edge `[source, target, weight]` in `edges`:
    * `source_root = self.find_root(source)`: Finds the root of the source node’s component.
    * `target_root = self.find_root(target)`: Finds the root of the target node’s component.
    * `min_path_cost[target_root] &= weight`: Updates the target component’s minimum cost using bitwise AND.
    * If `source_root != target_root`: Merges the components by updating `parent[source_root] = target_root` and combining costs with `min_path_cost[target_root] &= min_path_cost[source_root]`.

The assumption is that edge weights are processed to reflect the minimum cost (via AND) across all paths in a component.

## 4. Union-Find Implementation

* **Initialization**:
    * Each node starts as its own parent in `parent`.
    * `min_path_cost` is initialized to `-1` for each node.
* **Search Process**:
    * In `find_root`, a recursive search with path compression updates `parent[node]` to point directly to the root if `parent[node] != node`.
    * Returns the root of the component containing the node.
* **Merging**:
    * When merging components, the smaller component’s root is redirected to the larger one, and the minimum cost is updated accordingly.
* **Result**:
    * After processing all edges, `min_path_cost[root]` holds the minimum cost (via bitwise AND) for each component.

## 5. Returning the Result

* **Query Processing**: For each query `[start, end]` in `query`:
    * If `start == end`, appends `0` (no cost for the same node).
    * If `find_root(start) != find_root(end)`, appends `-1` (nodes are not connected).
    * Otherwise, appends `min_path_cost[find_root(start)]` (the minimum cost of the shared component).

The `minimumCost` method returns the list of results, representing the minimum cost or connectivity status for each query.

## In Essence

The code uses a Union-Find approach to group nodes into connected components and computes the minimum cost within each component using bitwise AND operations. By processing edges to merge components and track costs, then evaluating queries based on component membership, it determines the minimum cost between node pairs in $O(\alpha(n) * m + q)$ time complexity, where $m$ is the number of edges, $q$ is the number of queries, and $\alpha(n)$ is the inverse Ackermann function (nearly constant). This method efficiently handles graph connectivity and cost queries, leveraging the sorted nature of component merging and bitwise operations.

        parent = list(range(n))  # Initialize each node as its own parent

                parent[node] = find_root(parent[node])
            return parent[node]

        for source, target, weight in edges:

                parent[source_root] = target_root  # Merge components
