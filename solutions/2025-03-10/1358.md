## Explanation of the Python Code: Counting Substrings with All Three Characters

This Python code efficiently counts the number of substrings within a given string `s` that contain at least one occurrence of each character 'a', 'b', and 'c'.

Here's a breakdown of the code's logic:

**1. Initialization:**

* `count = 0`: Initializes a variable to store the total count of valid substrings.
* `left = 0`: Initializes the left pointer of the sliding window.
* `char_count = {'a': 0, 'b': 0, 'c': 0}`: Initializes a dictionary to keep track of the count of each character ('a', 'b', 'c') within the current sliding window.

**2. Sliding Window Approach:**

* The code uses a sliding window approach with two pointers, `left` and `right`.
* The `for` loop iterates through the string `s` using the `right` pointer, expanding the window.

**3. Expanding the Window:**

* For each character `s[right]` encountered, the code increments its count in the `char_count` dictionary.

**4. Shrinking the Window and Counting Valid Substrings:**

* The `while` loop checks if the current window contains at least one occurrence of each character ('a', 'b', 'c'). This is done by checking if `char_count['a'] > 0`, `char_count['b'] > 0`, and `char_count['c'] > 0`.
* If the current window is valid (contains all three characters), it means that all substrings starting from `left` and ending at any position from `right` to the end of the string are also valid. Therefore, the code increments `count` by `len(s) - right`. This directly adds the number of valid substrings that can be formed ending at the current `right` position.
* To shrink the window from the left, the code decrements the count of the character at the `left` pointer in the `char_count` dictionary.
* The `left` pointer is then moved one position to the right.

**5. Returning the Result:**

* After the loop finishes, the `count` variable contains the total count of valid substrings, which is returned.

**In essence, the code employs a sliding window technique to efficiently count the number of substrings that satisfy the condition of containing at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. It expands the window from the right and shrinks it from the left while maintaining a count of the characters within the window. Whenever a valid window is found, it efficiently calculates the number of valid substrings that can be formed from that window and adds it to the total count.**
