# 2787. Ways to Express an Integer as Sum of Powers

## Problem Description

Given two positive integers n and x, return the number of ways n can be expressed as the sum of the xth power of unique positive integers.

In other words, find the number of sets of unique integers [n1, n2, ..., nk] where n = n1^x + n2^x + ... + nk^x.

Since the result can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
- Input: n = 10, x = 2  
- Output: 1
- Explanation: We can express n as: n = 3² + 1² = 9 + 1 = 10

**Example 2:**
- Input: n = 4, x = 1
- Output: 2  
- Explanation: We can express n in the following ways:
  - n = 4¹ = 4
  - n = 3¹ + 1¹ = 3 + 1 = 4

### Constraints
- 1 <= n <= 300
- 1 <= x <= 5

## Solution Approach

This is a dynamic programming problem similar to the coin change problem, but with unique "coins" (each positive integer can only be used once).

### Algorithm:

1. **Find Maximum Number**: Determine the largest integer `max_num` such that `max_num^x <= n`

2. **Dynamic Programming**: Use `dp[i][j]` to represent the number of ways to make sum `i` using integers from 1 to `j`

3. **Transitions**:
   - Don't use number `j`: `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1]`
   - Use number `j`: `dp[i][j] += dp[i - j^x][j-1]` (if `i >= j^x`)

4. **Base Case**: `dp[0][j] = 1` for all j (one way to make sum 0: use no numbers)

### Time Complexity: O(n × max_num)
### Space Complexity: O(n × max_num)
