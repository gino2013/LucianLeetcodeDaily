# 2789. Largest Element in an Array after Merge Operations

## Problem Description

**Difficulty**: Medium

2789. Largest Element in an Array after Merge Operations
You are given a 0-indexed array nums consisting of positive integers.
You can do the following operation on the array any number of times:
Choose an index i such that 0 <= i < nums.length - 1 and nums[i] <= nums[i + 1]. Replace nums[i] with nums[i] + nums[i + 1] and delete nums[i + 1] from the array.
Return the largest possible value of an element in nums after performing the above operation any number of times.
Input: nums = [2,3,7,9,3]
Output: 21
Explanation: We can apply the operation on the array as follows:
- Choose index i = 0. We have nums[0] = 2 <= nums[1] = 3, so replace nums[0] with nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 3 = 5 and delete nums[1]. The array becomes [5,7,9,3].
- Choose index i = 1. We have nums[1] = 7 <= nums[2] = 9, so replace nums[1] with nums[1] + nums[2] = 7 + 9 = 16 and delete nums[2]. The array becomes [5,16,3].
- Choose index i = 0. We have nums[0] = 5 <= nums[1] = 16, so replace nums[0] with nums[0] + nums[1] = 5 + 16 = 21 and delete nums[1]. The array becomes [21,3].
- Since we cannot apply the operation anymore, the largest element is 21.
