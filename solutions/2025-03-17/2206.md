## Explanation of the Python Code: Divide Array into Pairs

This Python code determines whether an array of integers (`nums`) can be divided into pairs of equal numbers. The solution sorts the array and uses a binary search approach to find matching pairs, removing them until either all numbers are paired or a number cannot be paired. Here's a detailed breakdown of the code's logic:

### 1. Initialization:

- `nums.sort()`: The array is sorted in ascending order to make it easier to find pairs using binary search. This step has a time complexity of O(n log n), where `n` is the length of `nums`.
- The sorted array allows the algorithm to efficiently locate matching numbers by comparing the first element with others via binary search.

### 2. Binary Search Approach:

- The code uses a while loop combined with binary search to iteratively find and remove pairs of equal numbers.
- For each iteration, it takes the first element as the target and searches for its pair in the remaining array.

### 3. Pair Finding and Removal:

- **Main Loop: `while len(nums) >= 2`**
  - Continues as long as there are at least two elements left in the array to form a pair.
  - `target = nums[0]`: The first element is selected as the target to find its match.
  - `left, right = 1, len(nums) - 1`: Defines the binary search range starting from the second element to the end.
  - `found = False`: A flag to track if a pair is found.

- **Binary Search: `while left <= right`**
  - `mid = (left + right) // 2`: Calculates the middle index of the current search range.
  - If `nums[mid] == target`:
    - A pair is found (`found = True`).
    - `nums.pop(mid)`: Removes the matched number (O(n) operation due to array shifting).
    - `nums.pop(0)`: Removes the target number (O(n) operation).
    - Breaks the binary search loop.
  - If `nums[mid] < target`: Adjusts `left = mid + 1` (impossible in a sorted array with equal pairs, but included for completeness).
  - If `nums[mid] > target`: Adjusts `right = mid - 1` to search the lower half.

- **Pair Validation:**
  - If `not found`: Returns `False` immediately, as the target number cannot be paired.
  - Otherwise, continues to the next iteration after removing the pair.

### 4. Loop Implementation:

- **Initialization:**
  - Starts with the sorted array `nums`.
- **Search Process:**
  - The outer `while` loop runs approximately n/2 times (where n is the initial length), as it removes two elements per iteration.
  - The inner binary search runs in O(log n) time to find a match for the target.
  - If a pair is found, both elements are removed, and the process repeats.
  - If no pair is found, the function exits early with `False`.
- **Result:**
  - The loop continues until either all elements are removed (array becomes empty) or a number cannot be paired.

### 5. Returning the Result:

- Returns `len(nums) == 0`: 
  - `True` if the array is empty, meaning all numbers were successfully paired.
  - `False` if any numbers remain (odd count) or if a pair couldn’t be found earlier.

### In Essence:

The code uses a combination of sorting and binary search to determine if an array can be divided into pairs of equal numbers. It sorts the array initially (O(n log n)), then iteratively removes pairs by selecting the first element and using binary search (O(log n)) to find its match, with each removal costing O(n) due to the `pop` operations. The process repeats until all numbers are paired or a failure is detected. The overall time complexity is O(n²) due to the O(n) cost of array modifications dominating the binary search, and the space complexity is O(1) as it modifies the input array in-place. A more efficient solution could use a frequency counter (O(n)), but this approach demonstrates a binary search-based method.
