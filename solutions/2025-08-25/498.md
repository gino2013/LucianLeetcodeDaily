# 498. Diagonal Traverse

Given an m x n matrix mat, return an array of all the elements of the array in a diagonal order.

## Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: mat = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [1,2,4,7,5,3,6,8,9]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: mat = [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

## Constraints

- m == mat.length
- n == mat[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 10^4
- 1 <= m * n <= 10^4
- -10^5 <= mat[i][j] <= 10^5

## Approach

The key insight is to process diagonals one by one. Each diagonal can be identified by the sum of its row and column indices.

For diagonal `d`:
- All elements where `row + col = d` belong to the same diagonal
- We alternate direction for each diagonal:
  - Even diagonals (0, 2, 4, ...): traverse up-right
  - Odd diagonals (1, 3, 5, ...): traverse down-left

## Time Complexity: O(m * n)
## Space Complexity: O(1) excluding the result array
