## Explanation of the Solution

This solution aims to find the minimum number of operations needed to have at least `k` consecutive black blocks in a given string `blocks`, where 'W' represents white blocks and 'B' represents black blocks.

**Core Concept: Sliding Window**

The core idea is to use a sliding window of size `k` to traverse the `blocks` string. We maintain a count of black blocks within the window and calculate the number of operations needed to achieve `k` consecutive black blocks.

**Step-by-Step Explanation**

1.  **Initialization:**
    * `black_count = 0`: Initialize the count of black blocks in the window to 0.
    * `ans = float('inf')`: Initialize the minimum number of operations to positive infinity.

2.  **Sliding Window Loop:**
    * Iterate through the `blocks` string using a `for` loop.
    * **Add Right Block:**
        * If the current block is 'B', increment `black_count`.
    * **Remove Left Block:**
        * If the window has reached size `k` (i.e., `i >= k`), check if the leftmost block in the window (`blocks[i - k]`) is 'B'. If it is, decrement `black_count`.

3.  **Calculate Operations:**
    * Calculate the number of operations needed for the current window: `k - black_count`.
    * Update `ans` with the minimum of the current `ans` and the calculated operations.

4.  **Return Result:**
    * After iterating through all blocks, `ans` will hold the minimum number of operations. Return `ans`.

**Example**

Let's illustrate with an example:

* `blocks = "WBBWWBBW"`
* `k = 3`

Here's how the sliding window moves:

1.  **Window: "WBB"**
    * `black_count = 2`
    * Operations: `3 - 2 = 1`
    * `ans = 1`
2.  **Window: "BBW"**
    * `black_count = 2`
    * Operations: `3 - 2 = 1`
    * `ans = 1`
3.  **Window: "BWW"**
    * `black_count = 1`
    * Operations: `3 - 1 = 2`
    * `ans = 1`
4.  **Window: "WWB"**
    * `black_count = 1`
    * Operations: `3 - 1 = 2`
    * `ans = 1`
5.  **Window: "WBB"**
    * `black_count = 2`
    * Operations: `3 - 2 = 1`
    * `ans = 1`
6.  **Window: "BBW"**
    * `black_count = 2`
    * Operations: `3 - 2 = 1`
    * `ans = 1`

In this case, the minimum operations required is 1.

**Summary**

This solution efficiently calculates the minimum recoloring operations using a sliding window approach, ensuring a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the `blocks` string.
