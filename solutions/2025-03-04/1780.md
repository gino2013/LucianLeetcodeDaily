# Solution Approach: Check if a Number is a Sum of Powers of Three

## Problem Statement
Given an integer \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^7 \)), we need to determine if it is possible to express \( n \) as the sum of distinct powers of three (e.g., \( 3^0 = 1 \), \( 3^1 = 3 \), \( 3^2 = 9 \), etc.), where each power of three can be used at most once. Return `true` if such a representation exists, and `false` otherwise.

## Approach: Greedy Algorithm
The solution employs a greedy strategy to iteratively subtract the largest possible power of three from \( n \) while ensuring that each power is used at most once. This approach leverages the mathematical property that any positive integer can be represented using distinct powers of three (similar to a ternary system with digits restricted to 0 or 1, avoiding 2).

### Key Insights
- The maximum power of three to consider is determined by the constraint \( n \leq 10^7 \). Since \( 3^7 = 2187 \leq 10^7 \) and \( 3^8 = 6561 > 10^7 \), the highest power we need to check is \( 3^7 \).
- The greedy method works because the rapid growth of powers of three (exponential) ensures that subtracting the largest feasible power at each step will not miss a valid combination, provided we avoid reusing any power.
- This is equivalent to converting \( n \) into a ternary (base-3) representation where each digit is either 0 or 1 (no 2), which guarantees the use of distinct powers.

### Algorithm Steps
1. **Find the Maximum Power**:
   - Initialize `power = 0`.
   - Increment `power` while \( 3^{\text{power}} \leq n \). This identifies the largest exponent where \( 3^{\text{power}} \) does not exceed \( n \).
   - After the loop, decrement `power` by 1 to correct for the overshoot (the loop stops when \( 3^{\text{power}} > n \), so the previous value is the maximum valid power).

2. **Greedy Subtraction**:
   - Initialize `remaining = n` to track the remaining value to be represented.
   - Iterate `power` from the maximum value down to 0.
   - For each `power`, calculate \( \text{current_power_value} = 3^{\text{power}} \).
   - If `remaining >= current_power_value`, subtract \( \text{current_power_value} \) from `remaining` (using the current power of three).
   - Otherwise, skip to the next lower power (effectively setting the coefficient to 0 for that power).
   - Continue until `power` reaches 0.

3. **Validation**:
   - After the loop, check if `remaining == 0`. If true, \( n \) can be fully represented as a sum of distinct powers of three; return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(\log_3 n) \). The number of iterations is bounded by the number of relevant powers of three, which is approximately 7 for \( n \leq 10^7 \) (since \( \log_3(10^7) \approx 7 \)).
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \). Only a constant amount of extra space is used (variables `power` and `remaining`).

### Code Implementation
```python
class Solution:
    def checkPowersOfThree(self, n: int) -> bool:
        # Find the maximum power of 3 less than or equal to n
        power = 0
        while 3 ** power <= n:
            power += 1
        power -= 1  # Adjust to the largest valid power

        # Greedy method to subtract powers of 3
        remaining = n
        while power >= 0:
            current_power_value = 3 ** power
            if remaining >= current_power_value:
                remaining -= current_power_value
            power -= 1

        return remaining == 0
