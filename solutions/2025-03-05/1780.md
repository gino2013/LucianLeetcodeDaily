# Colored Cells Problem Solution

## Problem Description
The problem involves calculating the number of colored cells in a growing pattern based on an integer input `n`. The pattern starts with 1 colored cell when `n = 1` and increases in a specific way as `n` grows. We need to derive a formula to compute the total number of colored cells for any given `n`.

## Observations
From the code’s comments, we can observe the following examples:
- For `n = 1`, the number of colored cells is `1`.
- For `n = 2`, the number of colored cells is `1 + 2*2 = 5`.
- For `n = 3`, the number of colored cells is `1 + 2*2 + 8 = 13`.

These examples suggest a pattern that we can use to derive a general formula.

## Deriving the Formula
The number of colored cells, `f(n)`, appears to follow a quadratic function of the form:

f(n) = a*n^2 + b*n + c
```
Using the given data points:
1. When `n = 1`, `f(n) = 1`:
   ```
   a(1)^2 + b(1) + c = 1  →  a + b + c = 1  (Equation 1)
   ```
2. When `n = 2`, `f(n) = 5`:
   ```
   a(2)^2 + b(2) + c = 5  →  4a + 2b + c = 5  (Equation 2)
   ```
3. When `n = 3`, `f(n) = 13`:
   ```
   a(3)^2 + b(3) + c = 13  →  9a + 3b + c = 13  (Equation 3)
   ```

### Solving the Equations
- Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:
  ```
  (4a + 2b + c) - (a + b + c) = 5 - 1
  3a + b = 4  (Equation 4)
  ```
- Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 3:
  ```
  (9a + 3b + c) - (4a + 2b + c) = 13 - 5
  5a + b = 8  (Equation 5)
  ```
- Subtract Equation 4 from Equation 5:
  ```
  (5a + b) - (3a + b) = 8 - 4
  2a = 4  →  a = 2
  ```
- Substitute `a = 2` into Equation 4:
  ```
  3(2) + b = 4  →  6 + b = 4  →  b = -2
  ```
- Substitute `a = 2` and `b = -2` into Equation 1:
  ```
  2 + (-2) + c = 1  →  0 + c = 1  →  c = 1
  ```

Thus, the formula is:
```
f(n) = 2n^2 - 2n + 1
```

## Code Implementation
Here’s the Python code that implements this formula:

```python
class Solution:
    def coloredCells(self, n: int) -> int:
        # Calculate the number of colored cells using the derived formula
        colored_cells = 2 * n * n - 2 * n + 1
        return colored_cells
```

## Explanation of the Code
- The function `coloredCells` takes an integer `n` as input.
- It computes the result using the formula `2n^2 - 2n + 1`, where:
  - `2 * n * n` represents `2n^2`,
  - `-2 * n` represents `-2n`,
  - `+ 1` adds the constant term.
- The result is returned as an integer.

## Verification
- For `n = 1`: `2(1)^2 - 2(1) + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1` (matches).
- For `n = 2`: `2(2)^2 - 2(2) + 1 = 8 - 4 + 1 = 5` (matches).
- For `n = 3`: `2(3)^2 - 2(3) + 1 = 18 - 6 + 1 = 13` (matches).

The formula correctly computes the number of colored cells for the given pattern.

## Conclusion
The solution efficiently calculates the number of colored cells for any `n` using a quadratic formula derived from the observed pattern. The time complexity is `O(1)` since it involves only basic arithmetic operations.
