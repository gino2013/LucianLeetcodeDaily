## Explanation of the Python Code: Finding the Longest Subsequence of Words

This Python code efficiently determines the longest subsequence of indices from a given list of strings `words` and their corresponding group labels `groups`. The subsequence must satisfy two conditions: adjacent indices must have different group values, and the words at adjacent indices must have equal length with a Hamming distance of 1 (i.e., differ in exactly one character). The code uses a dynamic programming approach to achieve this in polynomial time complexity.

Here's a breakdown of the code's logic:

### 1. Initialization:

- `n = len(words)`: Stores the length of the input arrays `words` and `groups`, which are of equal length.
- `dp = [1] * n`: A list where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest valid subsequence ending at index `i`. Initialized to 1 since each index forms a subsequence of length 1 by itself.
- `prev = [-1] * n`: A list where `prev[i]` stores the index of the previous element in the longest subsequence ending at index `i`. Initialized to -1 to indicate no predecessor initially.

### 2. Hamming Distance Calculation:

- The code defines a helper function `hamming_distance(s1, s2)` to compute the number of positions where two strings differ.
- If the strings `s1` and `s2` have different lengths, it returns `float('inf')` to indicate they are invalid for the subsequence.
- Otherwise, it uses `zip` to pair corresponding characters and counts mismatches with `sum(c1 != c2 for c1, c2 in zip(s1, s2))`.

### 3. Dynamic Programming Approach:

- The code employs dynamic programming to find the longest subsequence satisfying the given conditions.
- For each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, it iterates over all previous indices `j` (from 0 to `i-1`) to check if including index `j` before `i` can extend the subsequence:
  - **Condition 1**: `groups[j] != groups[i]` ensures that the group labels of adjacent indices in the subsequence are different.
  - **Condition 2**: `hamming_distance(words[j], words[i]) == 1` ensures that the words at indices `j` and `i` have the same length and differ in exactly one character.
- If both conditions are met and `dp[j] + 1 > dp[i]`, it updates `dp[i]` to `dp[j] + 1` (extending the subsequence) and sets `prev[i] = j` to track the predecessor.

### 4. Finding the Longest Subsequence:

- After the dynamic programming loop, `max_len = max(dp)` finds the length of the longest subsequence.
- `end_idx = dp.index(max_len)` identifies the index where the longest subsequence ends.
- This approach ensures the subsequence with the maximum length is selected.

### 5. Reconstructing the Subsequence:

- The code reconstructs the subsequence by backtracking from `end_idx` using the `prev` array.
- Starting with `curr_idx = end_idx`, it appends `words[curr_idx]` to the result list and moves to the previous index via `curr_idx = prev[curr_idx]`.
- This continues until `curr_idx` becomes -1 (indicating no more predecessors).
- The result list is reversed (`result[::-1]`) to return the subsequence in the correct order (from start to end).

### In Essence:

The code uses a dynamic programming technique to find the longest subsequence of indices from the `words` and `groups` arrays, ensuring that adjacent indices have different group labels and their corresponding words have equal length with a Hamming distance of 1. By maintaining a `dp` array to track the longest subsequence length at each index and a `prev` array to store predecessors, it efficiently computes the solution. The Hamming distance function validates word pairs, and the backtracking step reconstructs the subsequence, returning the corresponding words in the correct order. The time complexity is O(n²·L), where `n` is the length of the input arrays and `L` is the maximum word length, due to the nested loop and Hamming distance computation.


# Explanation of the Python Code: Finding the Longest Subsequence of Words

This Python code efficiently determines the longest subsequence of indices from a given list of strings `words` and their corresponding group labels `groups`. The subsequence must satisfy two conditions: adjacent indices must have different group values, and the words at adjacent indices must have equal length with a Hamming distance of 1 (i.e., differ in exactly one character). The code uses a dynamic programming approach to achieve this in polynomial time complexity.

```python

    def getWordsInLongestSubsequence(self, words: List[str], groups: List[int]) -> List[str]:
        n = len(words)
        
        # Helper function to calculate Hamming distance
        def hamming_distance(s1: str, s2: str) -> int:
            if len(s1) != len(s2):
                return float('inf')
            return sum(c1 != c2 for c1, c2 in zip(s1, s2))
        
        # dp[i] stores the length of the longest subsequence ending at index i
        dp = [1] * n  # Initialize with 1 (each index is a subsequence of length 1)
        # prev[i] stores the previous index in the subsequence ending at i
        prev = [-1] * n
        
        # Dynamic programming
        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(i):
                if groups[j] != groups[i] and hamming_distance(words[j], words[i]) == 1:
                    if dp[j] + 1 > dp[i]:
                        dp[i] = dp[j] + 1
                        prev[i] = j
        
        # Find the end of the longest subsequence
        max_len = max(dp)
        end_idx = dp.index(max_len)
        
        # Reconstruct the subsequence
        result = []
        curr_idx = end_idx
        while curr_idx != -1:
            result.append(words[curr_idx])
            curr_idx = prev[curr_idx]
        
        return result[::-1]  # Reverse to get the correct order
```
