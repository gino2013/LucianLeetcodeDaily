# Explanation of the Python Code: Calculating Free Days Without Meetings

# This Python code efficiently calculates the number of free days in a given total `days`, excluding time occupied by meetings.
# It achieves this by sorting meetings and merging overlapping intervals, with a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of meetings.

## 1. Initialization
# - `meetings.sort()`: Sorts meetings by start time for sequential processing.
# - `meeting_days_count`: Tracks the total days occupied by meetings, initialized to 0.
# - `current_start` and `current_end`: Track the start and end times of the current continuous meeting interval, initially set to -1.

## 2. Meeting Interval Merging Approach
# The main method `countDays` iterates through the sorted meeting list, merging overlapping intervals and calculating total occupied days.

## 3. Processing Meetings and Computing Days
# - **Meeting Traversal**: For each meeting `[start, end]`:
#   - If `start > current_end`, a new interval starts; calculate days for the previous interval and update the new intervalâ€™s start and end.
#   - Otherwise, extend `current_end` to the later of the current end or new end time.
# - **Final Interval**: After the loop, calculate days for the last interval if it exists.

## 4. Returning the Result
# - **Free Days Calculation**: Subtract `meeting_days_count` from total `days` to get the result.
# - The method returns the number of days not occupied by meetings.

## In Essence
# The code sorts and linearly traverses meetings to merge overlapping intervals into continuous blocks, calculating occupied days.
# With a time complexity of O(n log n) (dominated by sorting), it efficiently handles meeting time conflicts,
# making it suitable for scheduling and resource allocation scenarios.
