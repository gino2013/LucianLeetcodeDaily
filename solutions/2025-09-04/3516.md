# 3516. Find Closest Person

## Problem Description

**Difficulty**: Medium

You are given three integers x, y, and z, representing the positions of three people on a number line:
x is the position of Person 1.
y is the position of Person 2.
z is the position of Person 3, who does not move.
Both Person 1 and Person 2 move toward Person 3 at the same speed.
Determine which person reaches Person 3 first:
Return 1 if Person 1 arrives first.
Return 2 if Person 2 arrives first.
Return 0 if both arrive at the same time.
Return the result accordingly.
Input: x = 2, y = 7, z = 4
Output: 1
Explanation:
Person 1 is at position 2 and can reach Person 3 (at position 4) in 2 steps.
Person 2 is at position 7 and can reach Person 3 in 3 steps.
Since Person 1 reaches Person 3 first, the output is 1.
Input: x = 2, y = 5, z = 6
Output: 2
Explanation:
Person 1 is at position 2 and can reach Person 3 (at position 6) in 4 steps.
Person 2 is at position 5 and can reach Person 3 in 1 step.
Since Person 2 reaches Person 3 first, the output is 2.
Input: x = 1, y = 5, z = 3
Output: 0
Explanation:
Person 1 is at position 1 and can reach Person 3 (at position 3) in 2 steps.
Person 2 is at position 5 and can reach Person 3 in 2 steps.
Since both Person 1 and Person 2 reach Person 3 at the same time, the output is 0.

## Solution Approach

### Method: Distance Comparison

The problem asks us to determine which person reaches Person 3 first. Since both Person 1 and Person 2 move at the same speed, the person who is closer to Person 3 will reach first. We simply need to calculate the absolute distance from each person to Person 3 and compare them.

### Algorithm Steps:

1. Calculate the distance from Person 1 to Person 3: |x - z|
2. Calculate the distance from Person 2 to Person 3: |y - z|
3. Compare the distances and return the appropriate result

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def findClosest(self, x: int, y: int, z: int) -> int:
        distance1 = abs(x - z)
        distance2 = abs(y - z)
        
        if distance1 < distance2:
            return 1
        elif distance2 < distance1:
            return 2
        else:
            return 0
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(1) - We only perform constant time operations
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - We only use a constant amount of extra space

## Example Tests

**Example 1:**
```
Input: x = 2, y = 7, z = 4

Output: 1

Explanation:

Person 1 is at position 2 and can reach Person 3 (at position 4) in 2 steps.
Person 2 is at position 7 and can reach Person 3 in 3 steps.
Since Person 1 reaches Person 3 first, the output is 1.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: x = 2, y = 5, z = 6

Output: 2

Explanation:

Person 1 is at position 2 and can reach Person 3 (at position 6) in 4 steps.
Person 2 is at position 5 and can reach Person 3 in 1 step.
Since Person 2 reaches Person 3 first, the output is 2.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: x = 1, y = 5, z = 3

Output: 0

Explanation:

Person 1 is at position 1 and can reach Person 3 (at position 3) in 2 steps.
Person 2 is at position 5 and can reach Person 3 in 2 steps.
Since both Person 1 and Person 2 reach Person 3 at the same time, the output is 0.
```

## Key Points

1. Both persons move at the same speed, so distance determines who arrives first
2. Use absolute value to calculate distance regardless of direction
3. Return 0 when distances are equal (tie case)

## 解題思路

### 方法：距離比較

這個問題要求我們判斷哪個人先到達第三個人。由於兩個人移動速度相同，距離較近的人會先到達。我們只需要計算每個人到第三個人的絕對距離並進行比較。

### 算法步驟:

1. 計算第一個人到第三個人的距離：|x - z|
2. 計算第二個人到第三個人的距離：|y - z|
3. 比較距離並返回相應的結果

## 代碼實現

```python
class Solution:
    def findClosest(self, x: int, y: int, z: int) -> int:
        distance1 = abs(x - z)
        distance2 = abs(y - z)
        
        if distance1 < distance2:
            return 1
        elif distance2 < distance1:
            return 2
        else:
            return 0
```

## 關鍵要點

1. 兩個人移動速度相同，所以距離決定誰先到達
2. 使用絕對值計算距離，不論方向
3. 當距離相等時返回 0（平手情況）
