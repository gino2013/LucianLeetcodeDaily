# 3195. Find the Minimum Area to Cover All Ones I

## Problem Description

**Difficulty**: Medium

You are given a 2D binary array grid. Find a rectangle with horizontal and vertical sides with the smallest area, such that all the 1's in grid lie inside this rectangle.

Return the minimum possible area of the rectangle.

## Solution Approach

### Method: Bounding Rectangle

The key insight is that we need to find the smallest rectangle that encloses all 1's in the grid. This rectangle is determined by:
- The topmost row containing a 1
- The bottommost row containing a 1  
- The leftmost column containing a 1
- The rightmost column containing a 1

### Algorithm Steps:

1. Initialize boundaries: `min_row`, `max_row`, `min_col`, `max_col`
2. Iterate through the entire grid to find all positions containing 1's
3. Update the boundaries whenever a 1 is found
4. Calculate the area as `(max_row - min_row + 1) * (max_col - min_col + 1)`

## Code Implementation

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minimumArea(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        
        # Find boundaries of all 1's
        min_row, max_row = m, -1
        min_col, max_col = n, -1
        
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    min_row = min(min_row, i)
                    max_row = max(max_row, i)
                    min_col = min(min_col, j)
                    max_col = max(max_col, j)
        
        # Calculate area of bounding rectangle
        height = max_row - min_row + 1
        width = max_col - min_col + 1
        return height * width
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n) where m and n are the dimensions of the grid
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) using only constant extra space

## Example Tests

**Example 1:**
```
Input: grid = [[0,1,0],[1,0,1]]

Output: 6

Explanation:

The smallest rectangle has a height of 2 and a width of 3, so it has an area of 2 * 3 = 6.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: grid = [[1,0],[0,0]]

Output: 1

Explanation:

The smallest rectangle has both height and width 1, so its area is 1 * 1 = 1.
```

## Key Points

1. **Bounding Rectangle**: The minimum area rectangle is simply the bounding rectangle of all 1's
2. **Boundary Tracking**: We only need to track the min/max row and column indices containing 1's
3. **Single Pass**: The solution requires only one pass through the grid to find all boundaries
4. **Edge Cases**: The problem guarantees at least one 1 exists, so we don't need to handle empty grids
