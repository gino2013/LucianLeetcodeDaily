# Explanation of the Python Code: Calculating Minimum Operations to Achieve Target Value k

# This Python code efficiently calculates the minimum number of operations required to achieve a target value `k` from a list of integers `nums`.  
# It uses a set-based approach to handle unique elements, with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of `nums`.

## 1. Initialization
# - The function `minOperations` takes two parameters: `nums` (a list of integers) and `k` (the target value).
# - It begins by checking a base condition to determine if the problem is solvable.

## 2. Feasibility Check
# - **Condition**: If `k` is greater than the smallest number in `nums`, it’s impossible to achieve `k` through operations.
#   - In this case, the function returns `-1` early to avoid unnecessary computations.

## 3. Unique Elements Processing
# - **Set Conversion**: The list `nums` is converted to a `set` to remove duplicates and obtain unique elements.
# - **Counting**: `unique_count` stores the number of unique elements in `nums`.

## 4. Computing Minimum Operations
# - **Case 1: `k` Exists in `nums`**:
#   - If `k` is already in the set of unique elements, the minimum operations required is `unique_count - 1`.
#   - This accounts for the fact that no additional operation is needed to reach `k`, reducing the count by 1.
# - **Case 2: `k` Does Not Exist in `nums`**:
#   - If `k` is not in the set, the minimum operations required equals `unique_count`.
#   - This assumes one operation per unique element is needed to transform the list to achieve `k`.

## 5. Returning the Result
# - **Output**: The function returns an integer representing the minimum operations needed:
#   - `-1` if impossible, `unique_count - 1` if `k` is present, or `unique_count` if `k` is absent.
# - This provides a clear and concise result based on the problem constraints.

## In Essence
# The code leverages a set to efficiently process unique elements in `nums` and determines the minimum operations needed to reach `k`.  
# With a time complexity of O(n) (dominated by set creation), it’s well-suited for scenarios involving list manipulation and target value calculations.
