LeetCode 3347: Maximum Frequency of an Element After Performing Operations II

Problem:
Given an integer array nums and two integers k and numOperations.
You must perform numOperations operations where each operation:
- Selects an index i that was not selected in any previous operations
- Adds an integer in the range [-k, k] to nums[i]

Return the maximum possible frequency of any element after performing the operations.

Approach:
1. For any target value t, an element nums[i] can become t if |nums[i] - t| <= k
2. For each potential target value:
   - Count elements already at target (no operation needed)
   - Count elements that can reach target (needs operation)
   - Max frequency = already_at_target + min(can_reach_target, numOperations)
3. Key insight: We only need to check values that elements can actually reach
   - Original values in nums
   - Boundary values: nums[i] - k and nums[i] + k

Time Complexity: O(n^2) where n is length of nums
Space Complexity: O(n) for storing potential targets
