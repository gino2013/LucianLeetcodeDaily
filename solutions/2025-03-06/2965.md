## Explanation: Finding Missing and Repeated Values

This code aims to identify the repeated and missing values within an `n x n` 2D integer array `grid`.

**Problem Statement:**

Given an `n x n` 2D integer array `grid` containing values within the range `[1, n^2]`. Each integer should appear exactly once, except for one integer `a` that appears twice, and another integer `b` that is missing. The objective is to determine `a` and `b`.

**Solution Approach:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    * `n`: Stores the dimension of the `grid` (i.e., `n`).
    * `count`: A dictionary to track the frequency of each value in the `grid`.
    * `repeated`: Stores the repeated value `a`.
    * `missing`: Stores the missing value `b`.

2.  **Frequency Counting:**
    * Iterate through each element in the `grid` using nested loops.
    * For each element `num`, update its count in the `count` dictionary using `count.get(num, 0) + 1`.
        * `count.get(num, 0)`: Retrieves the current count of `num` (or 0 if it's not present).
        * `+ 1`: Increments the count of `num`.
    * After this step, the `count` dictionary reflects the occurrence of each value.

3.  **Identifying Repeated and Missing Values:**
    * Iterate through the range of possible values from `1` to `n^2`.
    * For each value `i`:
        * If `count.get(i, 0)` equals 2, then `i` is the repeated value, so assign it to `repeated`.
        * If `count.get(i, 0)` equals 0, then `i` is the missing value, so assign it to `missing`.

4.  **Returning the Result:**
    * Return a list `[repeated, missing]` containing the determined values.

**Code Breakdown:**

```python
class Solution:
    def findMissingAndRepeatedValues(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(grid)
        count = {}
        for row in grid:
            for num in row:
                count[num] = count.get(num, 0) + 1

        repeated = 0
        missing = 0

        for i in range(1, n * n + 1):
            if count.get(i, 0) == 2:
                repeated = i
            elif count.get(i, 0) == 0:
                missing = i

        return [repeated, missing]
