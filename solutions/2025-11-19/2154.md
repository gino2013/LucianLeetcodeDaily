## Problem Description

**Difficulty**: Medium

2154. Keep Multiplying Found Values by Two
You are given an array of integers nums. You are also given an integer original which is the first number that needs to be searched for in nums.
You then do the following steps:
If original is found in nums, multiply it by two (i.e., set original = 2 * original).
Otherwise, stop the process.
Repeat this process with the new number as long as you keep finding the number.
Return the final value of original.
Input: nums = [5,3,6,1,12], original = 3
Output: 24
Explanation: 
- 3 is found in nums. 3 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 6.
- 6 is found in nums. 6 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 12.
- 12 is found in nums. 12 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 24.
- 24 is not found in nums. Thus, 24 is returned.
Input: nums = [2,7,9], original = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
- 4 is not found in nums. Thus, 4 is returned.

## Solution Approach

### Method: Hash Set Lookup

The solution uses a hash set to efficiently check if a number exists in the array. We keep multiplying the original value by 2 as long as it exists in the set.

### Algorithm Steps:

1. Convert the `nums` array to a set for O(1) lookup operations
2. While `original` exists in the set:
   - Multiply `original` by 2
3. Return the final value of `original`

## Code Implementation

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findFinalValue(self, nums: List[int], original: int) -> int:
        num_set = set(nums)

        while original in num_set:
            original *= 2

        return original
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n + k) where n is the length of nums (to create the set) and k is the number of times we multiply (typically very small)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the set

## Example Tests

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [5,3,6,1,12], original = 3
Output: 24
Explanation: 
- 3 is found in nums. 3 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 6.
- 6 is found in nums. 6 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 12.
- 12 is found in nums. 12 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 24.
- 24 is not found in nums. Thus, 24 is returned.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [2,7,9], original = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
- 4 is not found in nums. Thus, 4 is returned.
```

## Key Points

1. Using a set instead of a list provides O(1) lookup time instead of O(n)
2. The while loop will terminate when we can't find the next doubled value
3. In the worst case, we can only double log(max_value) times due to the constraint that all values are <= 1000

## 解題思路

### 方法：雜湊集合查找

此解法使用雜湊集合（Hash Set）來高效檢查數字是否存在於陣列中。只要原始值存在於集合中，就持續將其乘以 2。

### 算法步驟:

1. 將 `nums` 陣列轉換為集合，以實現 O(1) 的查找操作
2. 當 `original` 存在於集合中時：
   - 將 `original` 乘以 2
3. 返回 `original` 的最終值

## 代碼實現

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findFinalValue(self, nums: List[int], original: int) -> int:
        num_set = set(nums)

        while original in num_set:
            original *= 2

        return original
```

## 複雜度分析

- **時間複雜度**: O(n + k)，其中 n 是 nums 的長度（用於創建集合），k 是乘法次數（通常很小）
- **空間複雜度**: O(n)，用於存儲集合

## 範例測試

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [5,3,6,1,12], original = 3
Output: 24
Explanation: 
- 3 is found in nums. 3 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 6.
- 6 is found in nums. 6 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 12.
- 12 is found in nums. 12 is multiplied by 2 to obtain 24.
- 24 is not found in nums. Thus, 24 is returned.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [2,7,9], original = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
- 4 is not found in nums. Thus, 4 is returned.
```

## 關鍵要點

1. 使用集合而非列表可提供 O(1) 的查找時間，而非 O(n)
2. while 迴圈會在找不到下一個加倍值時終止
3. 最壞情況下，由於所有值都 <= 1000 的限制，我們最多只能加倍 log(max_value) 次
