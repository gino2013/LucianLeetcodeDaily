## Explanation of the Python Code: Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer

This Python code efficiently converts a singly-linked list, where each node contains either 0 or 1, into its corresponding decimal (base-10) value. The most significant bit is at the head of the linked list.

Here's a breakdown of the code's logic:

### 1. Problem Description:

- Given a singly-linked list representing a binary number, return its decimal value.
- The head node is the most significant bit.
- Example: head = [1,0,1] represents binary 101, which is 5 in decimal.

### 2. Approach:

- Traverse the linked list from head to tail.
- Use an integer variable `num` to accumulate the result.
- For each node, update `num = num * 2 + node.val` to shift left and add the current bit.
- Continue until the end of the list.

### 3. Code Implementation:

```python
from typing import Optional

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def getDecimalValue(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> int:
        num = 0
        while head:
            num = num * 2 + head.val
            head = head.next
        return num
```

### 4. Complexity Analysis:

- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list (each node is visited once).
- Space Complexity: O(1), only a constant amount of extra space is used.

### 5. Summary:

The code uses a simple traversal and bit manipulation to convert the binary number in the linked list to its decimal representation. This is efficient and straightforward, requiring only a single pass through the list.
