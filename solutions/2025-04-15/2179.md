## Explanation of the Python Code: Counting Good Triplets

This Python code efficiently counts the number of "good triplets" in two arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, where a good triplet is defined as a set of three indices `(i, j, k)` such that `i < j < k`, and the relative order of elements in `nums1` at these indices matches their relative order in `nums2`. The code uses a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT, also known as a Fenwick Tree) to achieve this in sub-quadratic time complexity.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the code’s logic:

### 1. Initialization:

- `n = len(nums1)`: Stores the length of the input arrays (both `nums1` and `nums2` are of equal length).
- `pos = [0] * n`: Creates an array to map each value in `nums2` to its index, indicating its position in `nums2`.
  - For each index `i` and value `val` in `nums2`, `pos[val] = i` records the position of `val` in `nums2`.
- `mapped = [pos[val] for val in nums1]`: Transforms `nums1` into a list of indices based on the positions of its values in `nums2`.
  - For each value `val` in `nums1`, `mapped[i] = pos[val]` gives the index of `val` in `nums2`. This maps `nums1` into the "world" of `nums2`’s ordering.

### 2. Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) Setup:

The code uses a BIT to efficiently count elements in a range, which is crucial for computing the number of valid elements before and after each index in the mapped array. The BIT supports two operations:

- `update(bit, idx, val)`: Updates the BIT by adding `val` to the element at index `idx` and all subsequent indices affected by `idx` (using the low-bit trick `idx += idx & -idx`).
  - This increments the count of elements at `idx` (1-indexed in BIT) and propagates the update to higher indices.
- `query(bit, idx)`: Computes the prefix sum from index 1 to `idx` in the BIT, representing the count of elements up to `idx`.
  - It traverses the BIT backward using `idx -= idx & -idx` to accumulate the sum.

### 3. Counting Elements to the Left:

- `left = [0] * n`: An array to store, for each index `i`, the number of elements before `i` in `mapped` that are less than `mapped[i]`.
- A BIT (`bit = [0] * (n + 2)`) is initialized to track the frequency of indices encountered.
- The code iterates through `mapped` from `i = 0` to `n-1`:
  - `left[i] = query(bit, mapped[i])`: Queries the BIT to count how many elements with indices less than `mapped[i]` have been seen so far (i.e., elements `mapped[j]` for `j < i` where `mapped[j] < mapped[i]`).
  - `update(bit, mapped[i] + 1, 1)`: Updates the BIT to mark that `mapped[i]` has been seen, incrementing the count at index `mapped[i] + 1` (since BIT is 1-indexed).
- This step computes, for each position `i`, how many prior elements could serve as the first element of a triplet `(a, i, b)` where `a < i` and `mapped[a] < mapped[i]`.

### 4. Counting Elements to the Right:

- `right = [0] * n`: An array to store, for each index `i`, the number of elements after `i` in `mapped` that are greater than `mapped[i]`.
- A new BIT (`bit = [0] * (n + 2)`) is initialized.
- The code iterates through `mapped` in reverse, from `i = n-1` to `0`:
  - `right[i] = query(bit, n) - query(bit, mapped[i] + 1)`: Computes the number of elements with indices greater than `mapped[i]` that are yet to be processed (i.e., elements `mapped[k]` for `k > i` where `mapped[k] > mapped[i]`).
    - `query(bit, n)` gives the total count of elements in the BIT.
    - `query(bit, mapped[i] + 1)` gives the count of elements up to `mapped[i] + 1`, so the difference is the count of elements with indices `> mapped[i]`.
  - `update(bit, mapped[i] + 1, 1)`: Updates the BIT to mark that `mapped[i]` has been seen.
- This step computes, for each position `i`, how many subsequent elements could serve as the third element of a triplet `(a, i, b)` where `i < b` and `mapped[i] < mapped[b]`.

### 5. Computing Good Triplets:

- For each index `i` to be the middle of a triplet `(a, i, b)`:
  - `left[i]` represents the number of valid choices for `a` (indices `a < i` where `mapped[a] < mapped[i]`).
  - `right[i]` represents the number of valid choices for `b` (indices `b > i` where `mapped[i] < mapped[b]`).
  - The product `left[i] * right[i]` gives the number of valid triplets with `i` as the middle index, because each choice of `a` can pair with each choice of `b`.
- The total number of good triplets is computed as `sum(left[i] * right[i] for i in range(n))`.

### In Essence:

The code efficiently counts good triplets by transforming `nums1` into the relative order of `nums2` using a mapping (`mapped`). It uses a Binary Indexed Tree to compute:
- For each index `i`, the number of prior elements `a` where `mapped[a] < mapped[i]` (`left[i]`).
- For each index `i`, the number of subsequent elements `b` where `mapped[i] < mapped[b]` (`right[i]`).
The product `left[i] * right[i]` gives the number of valid triplets with `i` as the middle, and the sum of these products yields the total count. The use of BIT ensures that both counting operations are performed in `O(n log n)` time, making the overall complexity `O(n log n)` for a list of length `n`.
