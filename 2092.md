# 2092. Find All People With Secret

## Problem Description
Given `n` people (0 to n-1), person 0 initially has a secret and shares it with `firstPerson` at time 0. We have a list of meetings `[xi, yi, timei]` where person `xi` meets person `yi` at time `timei`. When two people meet and at least one has the secret, both will have it after. Secrets are shared instantaneously within the same time frame. Return all people who have the secret after all meetings.

## Approach
The key insight is that meetings at the same time can create chains of secret sharing. We need to:

1. **Group meetings by time**: Meetings at the same time need to be processed together
2. **Process chronologically**: Handle meetings in time order
3. **Propagate within time frames**: Use BFS/DFS to spread the secret among all connected people at each time point

### Algorithm
1. Initialize `has_secret` set with person 0 and `firstPerson`
2. Group all meetings by their time
3. For each time point (sorted):
   - Build a graph of all meetings at this time
   - Find all people with the secret who are in meetings at this time
   - Use BFS to propagate the secret to all connected people
   - Update the global `has_secret` set
4. Return sorted list of all people with the secret

### Why BFS/Graph Approach?
Consider meetings at time T: `[[1,2,T], [2,3,T], [3,4,T]]`
- If person 1 has the secret, they share with person 2
- Person 2 immediately shares with person 3 (same time frame)
- Person 3 immediately shares with person 4 (same time frame)
- All of 1,2,3,4 end up with the secret at time T

This is essentially finding connected components where at least one node has the secret.

## Complexity
- **Time**: O(M log M + M + E) where M = number of meetings, E = total edges in graphs
  - O(M log M) for sorting times
  - O(M) for grouping meetings
  - O(E) for BFS across all time frames
- **Space**: O(N + M) for graph storage and tracking secret holders

## Edge Cases
- Multiple meetings at the same time creating chains
- People attending multiple meetings at different times
- Person with secret meeting someone who already has it
- firstPerson = 0 (though constraints say firstPerson >= 1)
