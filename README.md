# LucianLeetCodeDaily

## Description
This repository serves as a comprehensive log of my daily LeetCode practice challenges throughout 2025. My goal is to systematically enhance my proficiency in algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques by tackling one problem each day. All solutions are implemented in Python, accompanied by detailed explanations of the approach, time complexity, and space complexity. This project is designed to track my progress, document my learning journey, and prepare for technical interviews or competitive programming. I warmly invite fellow developers, learners, and enthusiasts to join me on this endeavor, share insights, and grow together!

## Project Background
Initiated on March 4, 2025, this repository reflects my commitment to continuous learning and skill development in computer science. Inspired by the need to strengthen my foundation for software engineering roles, I aim to cover a wide range of LeetCode problems, spanning Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulties. The solutions are version-controlled using Git, hosted on GitHub, and organized by date for easy reference. This project also serves as a portfolio piece to demonstrate my coding consistency and problem-solving capabilities.

## Progress
- **2025-03-04**: [Powers of Three](solutions/2025-03-04/powers_of_three.py)  
  - Problem ID: [LeetCode #1780](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-number-is-a-sum-of-powers-of-three/)  
  - Approach: Greedy algorithm with \( O(\log_3 n) \) time complexity and \( O(1) \) space complexity.  
  - Notes: Utilized the property of ternary representation to ensure distinct powers of three.  
- **...** (More entries will be added daily)

## Goals
- **Daily Commitment**: Solve and document at least one LeetCode problem each day in 2025, targeting a minimum of 365 problems.
- **Skill Enhancement**: Master core computer science concepts, including dynamic programming, graph traversal, binary search, and more.
- **Interview Preparation**: Build a robust problem-solving toolkit to excel in technical interviews for software engineering positions.
- **Community Engagement**: Foster a collaborative environment by sharing knowledge and receiving feedback.

## Technical Details
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x (preferred for its readability and extensive libraries).
- **Version Control**: Managed with Git, using the `main` branch as the default.
- **File Structure**:
  - `solutions/YYYY-MM-DD/`: Daily solution files (e.g., `.py` for code, `.md` for explanations).
  - `notes/`: Optional directory for general learning notes or summaries.
- **Documentation**: Each solution includes a Markdown file with problem statement, approach, complexity analysis, and optimization considerations.
